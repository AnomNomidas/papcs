# papcs - A Pretty Accurate Playing Cards Simulator
A pretty accurate standard 52-card playing cards simulator, built using tkinter. Create cards (from the usual 52-card set), flip them face up or down, and arrange them on your screen as you like. Useful for practicing Solitaire or math-based card magic tricks.   

Requires Python 3. Run papcs.py to start. 
Controls:
- Right-click an empty space to bring up a context menu (currently only "Create a card...")
- Right-click a card to flip its facing (facedown to faceup, faceup to facedown)
- Click and drag cards to move them around
- Cards are stacked in order of their creation. To bring a card to front, click the middle mouse button.

Planned features:
- Card piles: create, delete, shuffle, and deal to other piles
- Save/load board states
- Better UI
